### Key features:

#### Weighted Random 

When playing a playlist mix of ```liked songs``` and regular songs in random order,
```liked songs``` have a higher chance to get played.

#### Improved Random Song Choose

Sometimes, one song is played several times, but many songs have not been played.
I solved this problem by using a counter.
In this player, there will be no song plays much more than other songs except liked songs.

#### Search

It is straightforward to find songs in a playlist.
